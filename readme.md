# [Redox](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard) W Pro Micro receiver

The original Redox keyboard is using receiver that consists from the Arduino Pro Micro board and custom made "shield"
that is used to put few leds and a YJ-14015 module (Core51822B clone).

This PCB uses the on board copper connection to plug directly into the computer.
 
The rest of the board can be used the same way, there is a programming port for YJ-14015 module.
